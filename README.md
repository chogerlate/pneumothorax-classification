# Pneumothorax Classification

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for classifying pneumothorax conditions from medical images. The project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze and predict the presence of pneumothorax in chest X-ray images.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Internet connection for downloading model weights

## Weights Downloading
Before building the Docker image, you need to download the pre-trained model weights. Follow these steps:

1. Create a directory named `weights` in the root of the repository:
    ```sh
    mkdir weights
    ```
2. Download the weights file from the provided link and place it in the `weights` directory. For example:
    ```sh
    wget -O weights/model_weights.h5 https://example.com/path/to/weights/model_weights.h5
    ```

## Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, navigate to the root of the repository and run the following command:
```sh
docker build -t pneumothorax-classification .
```

## Running the Docker Container
Once the Docker image is built, you can run the container using the following command:
```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 pneumothorax-classification
```

This will start the application, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
